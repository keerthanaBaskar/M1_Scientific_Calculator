## M1_Scientific Calculator
# ** SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR **
  A Scientific Calculator or digital calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not handheld,designed to calculate problem in science,Engineering,Mathematics etc.,
## Introduction
In this project, a version of scientific calculator program in c which will perform basic arithmetic operation like addition,subtraction,multiplication division,modulus along with some scientific and 
trignometric operations,depending on the input from the user.
## Objective
The main objevtive of this project are:
* To perform the required operation mentioned by the user.
* To meet the requirement by giving the same result as output.
## SWOT Analysis
# Strength:

    * It can solve the basic arithmetic operations.
    * Some complex operation such as square root and trignometric operations are performed.
# Weakness:

   * In case of trignometric calculations,it invloves most complex functions which leads to missing of values.
# Oppurtunities:
 
   * Exponential , Trignometric calculations can be implemented to higher.
# Threats:
    
    * If the user enters the high data than the fixed size, it throws error and return by quitting the function.
    * The user needs to enter the same fixed data to get the required output.
