## M1_Scientific Calculator
#                     ** SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR **
  A Scientific Calculator or digital calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not handheld,designed to calculate problem in science,Engineering,Mathematics etc.,
## Introduction
In this project, a version of scientific calculator program in c which will perform basic arithmetic operation like addition,subtraction,multiplication division,modulus along with some scientific and 
trignometric operations,depending on the input from the user.
## Research
The Scientific Calculator System does not involve any complex operations. It is easy to apply the operations in the systems to find the required result rather than 
spending the time by applying the techniques and formulas. Thus by finding and studying all these facts,the necessary functions has been implemented to get the proper results in a required or better way. 
## Objective
The main objective of this project are:
* To perform the required operation mentioned by the user.
* To meet the requirement by giving the same result as output.
## Cost and Featues
### Cost
The cost implementation of this project is minimal to none. Depending on the project extensions,how it is built and all the requirement will meet the cost and it can be varied accordingly to the market and business need.
### Features
| Feature ID | Feature Name | Features |

| F01 | Addition | add();takes the input form user and returns a+b |
| F02 | Subtraction | sub();takes the input from user and returns a-b |
| F03 | Multiplication | multiply();takes the input form user and returns a * b |

## SWOT Analysis
### Strength:

   * It can solve the basic arithmetic operations.
   * Some complex operation such as square root and trignometric operations are performed.
### Weakness:

   * In case of trignometric calculations,it invloves most complex functions which leads to missing of values.
### Oppurtunities:
 
   * Exponential , Trignometric calculations can be implemented to higher.
### Threats:
    
   * If the user enters the high data than the fixed size, it throws error and return by quitting the function.
   * The user needs to enter the same fixed data to get the required output.

  ### Best methods to be followed
  * Used functions to decrease dependency on main functions.
  * Used pointers, functions and built-in functions to accept the input from user and store the values which helped in creating easy design of scientific calculator.
  * Printf statements have been placed only whenever necessary to maximum lines of code and confusions.
  * Created header file so that the function can be used else where ever required without any difficulty.
